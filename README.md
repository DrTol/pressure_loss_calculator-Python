# Pressure Loss Calculator Tool - Python (SI Units)
A Python tool calculating the friction pressure loss (head loss) in circular pipes with full flow water, based on Darcy-Weisbach using Clamond algorithm for the friction factor. 

- Excel functions (also as add-in) for the same calculator/s can be found in [pressure_loss_calculator-Excel.git](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Excel.git).
- Matlab functions for the same calculator/s can be found in [pressure_loss_calculator-Matlab.git](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Matlab).

## Requirements
This tool requires that `XSteamPython` and `SciPy` be installed. Please see [XSteamPython.git](https://github.com/raldridge11/XSteamPython)

## How2Use
Please see [ExampleScript.py](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Python/blob/master/ExampleScript.py)

## License
You are free to use, modify and distribute the code as long as authorship is properly acknowledged. The same applies for the original works 'XSteam.m' by Holmgren M. and 'colebrook.m' by Clamond D, this repository Python tools make use of.

## Acknowledgement 
In memory of my mother Esma Tol and my father Bekir Tol.

We would like to acknowledge all of the open-source minds in general for their willing of share (as apps or comments/answers in forums), which has encouraged our department to publish our Python tools developed during the PhD study here in GitHub.
